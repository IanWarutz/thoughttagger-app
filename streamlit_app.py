st.markdown("""
### What is Thought Tagging?
Thought tagging is the practice of writing down your thoughts and attaching descriptive tags (like 'anxiety', 'gratitude', 'goals', or 'self-doubt') to each one.  
This simple act helps you:
- **Restore inner chaos:** By labeling your thoughts, you externalize and organize them, making them less overwhelming.
- **Gain clarity:** Tagging helps you recognize patterns, triggers, and recurring themes in your thinking.
- **Foster self-awareness:** Over time, you‚Äôll see which thoughts dominate your mind, empowering you to make positive changes.
- **Support emotional wellbeing:** Understanding your thought patterns is a key step toward emotional regulation and mental clarity.
